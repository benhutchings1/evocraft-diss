# Procedural content generation through the use of genetic algorithms (working title)
## Abstract

##  Introduction
Procedural content generation (PCG) is a technique used in video game design and other creative fields, such as art and music. The technique allows creators to generate a near infinite amount of content based on a few rules, constraints, and parameters. This allows games to be highly replayable, feeling more unique and unpredictable. An example of effective PCG is in No Man’s Sky, a universe exploration game which can generate 2^64 (~18x10^18) worlds, each roughly 78.5 miles^2 (~203 sqkm). Comparing this to one the biggest non-generated games, ARMA 3, which has a map size of 270 sqkm, barely bigger than one of the quintillions of the worlds in No Mans’ Sky.
PCG does come with some downsides, mainly sacrificing quality control. A traditional game would have game designers’ hand-designing all aspects of the game, meaning the output is predetermined and easily controllable. Since PCG is designed to be unending, it is impossible to quality check everything. This can lead to some areas of a game being unplayable or the content eventually becoming repetitive. Another drawback is the processing costs. Since the content is being generated, instead of being read from the games files, there is a much larger overhead. 
Outside of games, machine learning based PCG has made massive leaps forward. Models such as DALL-E 2  can generate completely unique photo-realistic images from a text description, and ChatGPT can generate text answers to almost any question. These models have been so successful through the enormous amount of data they have been trained on and the huge complexity of the models, which both present problems for PCG. For a new game designer, it is very unlikely there exists a dataset large enough to adequately train a deep learning model to create a convincing and realistic world. These models are also hugely computationally expensive, which for large scale PCG is impractical. 
Another issue is the idea of creativity. Models such as DALL-E and ChatGPT do produce unique outputs, but the output is based on many existing sources. For these models this is not a big problem because of the huge amount of training data which allows the models to draw on many sources to generate new content. Games on the other hand generally have the same recognisable styles and artifacts throughout the world. A model splicing these together could lead to a disjointed world and recognisable from other games, leading to lower immersion. 
One solution to this is through the use of evolution algorithms
