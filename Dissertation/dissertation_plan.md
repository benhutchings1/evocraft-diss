# Using genetic algorithms to develop artificial structures (working title)
##  Introduction
- Motivation and rationale
- Procedural content generation, open ended algorithms
- Neural nets can only build off existing information
- Generates structures with no knowledge of existing structures
- Dont have to curate massive database
-
