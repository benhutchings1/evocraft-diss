# Title
##  Introduction (~2-3 pages)
- Motivation and rationale
- Procedural content generation, open ended algorithms
    - Games
        - Good design can make or break game
        - Infinite content generation
        - Increased replayability
        - Reduced file sizes for games
        - Lower budgets for games
        - No mans sky
    - Art generation/Urban modelling (non games uses)
- Neural nets can only build off existing information
- Generates structures with no knowledge of existing structures
- Dont have to curate massive database
-

    - i am focusing on a much smaller scale generation, they focused on large scale diversity?
-
    - Open ended frameworks
## Method (~10-12 pages)
- Type of novelty search
    - KNN
    - Archived ancestors
- Experiment
    - Test with no novelty
    - Test with low novelty
    - test medium novelty
    - test high novelty
    - Dynamic diversity? diversity coefficient changes the most stable a fitness becomes
## Evaluation (~5-7 pages)
- Minecraft performance 
- Fitness over time
    - Max, mean, min, fitness
    - Performance scaling with size of building generated
- Novelty can be high but has to be human novelty which is hgih
-
