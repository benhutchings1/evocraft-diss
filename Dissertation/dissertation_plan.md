# Title
##  Introduction (~2-3 pages)
- Motivation and rationale
- Procedural content generation, open ended algorithms
    - Games
        - Good design can make or break game
        - Infinite content generation
        - Increased replayability
        - Reduced file sizes for games
        - Lower budgets for games
        - No mans sky
    - Art generation/Urban modelling (non games uses)
- Neural nets can only build off existing information
- Generates structures with no knowledge of existing structures
- Dont have to curate massive database
